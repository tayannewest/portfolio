# Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ’œ

Portfolios: We've all got 'em. Who needs 'em? Developers, apparently. So here's mine!

## Built with ReactJs

I'm striving to get as proficient as possible with several languages, but currently have a soft spot for JavaScript and React, so that's what I'm chosing to show off here.

## But wait, won't this portfolio just lead me back to your GitHub if I'm looking for your projects? ðŸ¤”

It can if you want it to. But you can also send me a message, find me on LinkedIn, or visit my other deployed sites without having to navigate back through my repositories.
